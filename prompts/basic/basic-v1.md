## 1. **Multi-Modal Portfolio Generator**

```markdown
Design a single-page personal portfolio generator.  
- User uploads a profile picture, adds a short bio, and lists 3 projects.  
- The site instantly updates with a visually cohesive, responsive layout using modern web aesthetics (choose a creative color palette and font pairing).  
- All interactions and updates should happen live in-browser.  
- Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
```


## 2. **Real-Time Mood Board Composer**

```markdown
Create a real-time “mood board” app:  
- User can drag and drop images or type mood keywords to generate color palettes and inspirational quotes (generate these in-code, no API calls).  
- Allow users to move, resize, and delete elements on the board.  
- Style: minimal, artsy, highly interactive.  
- Use HTML/CSS/JS only.
```


## 3. **No-Backend Survey Maker**

```markdown
Build a no-backend survey creator:  
- Users can create a quick survey (title + 3 questions, text or multiple choice).  
- Link to take the survey appears instantly; responses are tracked client-side only and visualized as simple charts or stats.  
- UX should feel inviting, smooth, and intuitive.  
- HTML, CSS, JS only.
```


## 4. **AI-Style Code Reviewer (Web)**

```markdown
Develop an interactive code reviewer tool for web:  
- Users paste in a code snippet (JS, Python, or HTML).  
- The app gives instant, helpful feedback and suggestions (generated by you, no AI API).  
- Style: friendly, clean, “developer desk” vibe with light/dark toggle.  
- Use HTML, CSS, JS.
```


## 5. **Data Vibe Explorer (Python)**

```markdown
Create a data “vibe explorer” in Python (Jupyter/Streamlit):  
- User uploads a CSV.  
- Instantly visualize main insights: trends, outliers, category breakdowns (pick appropriate chart types automatically).  
- Add a “vibe score” (your own simple metric, explained in the app) for the dataset.  
- Prioritize beautiful, clear layout and friendly user guidance.
```


## 6. **Generative Sound Playground**

```markdown
Build a generative sound playground (web):  
- Users can click, drag, or press keys to trigger fun sound patterns and animated visuals.  
- Include a small set of preset sound “vibes” (e.g., chill, energetic, mysterious).  
- Prioritize playful UI, responsive feedback, and creative audio-visual interaction.  
- HTML, CSS, JS only; use the Web Audio API.
